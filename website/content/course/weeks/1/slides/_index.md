# Harassment

We do not tolerate harassment at CodeYourFuture.
Please report to a CYF Staff Member in your region.

{{% speaker-notes %}}
Persistent harassment may lead to police involvement.
People should feel empowered to ask the person to stop. One no is sufficient‚Ä¶. If you have to ask is it harassment - IT'S PROBABLY HARASSMENT. It's not about individuals, it's about engendering a community capable of saying no and supporting each other, If you think it might be harassment, it's probably harassment What is harassment? If you are thinking is this harassment, this is not harrassment

The list is not exhaustive.
Unwanted behaviour may lead to warnings, even if the behaviour is not meant to offend or intimidate.
In extreme cases, unwanted behaviour may lead to expulsion from the community.

We cannot make a complete list .It's dependent on other people's boundaries. They decide. We might not always know, so it's important that we ask. What is an extreme case?

# How to report

### Community Safety team

{{<frag c="Please tell a CYF staff member.">}}
{{<frag c="If you do not get a response within a week, please email cs@codeyourfuture.io">}}
{{% speaker-notes %}}
Why do you discuss it with Staff member? For a coordinated response. Volunteers are lovely, it's also not why they are here. Why is there an email? Because we welcome it, if you feel like I have violated the CofC, If I have made anyone feel uncomfortable, please report me so I can learn and grow.

# Professional Boundaries

{{% speaker-notes %}}
Professional boundaries is the difference between your personal and professional life. They are put in place to make sure that we are working in a safe and inclusive environment at all times.
We are all expected to be professional at all times at CYF.
Examples of keeping professional boundaries are:
Maintaining professional language at all times
Maintaining personal space and keeping physical contact at a professional level at all times
Understanding the difference between personal friendships and professional relationships

Why we need professional boundaries This is not a place we can just leave if we feel uncomfortable, We all deserve to be here, and to have all our energy focused on our future. We need to be comfortable. So we need professional boundaries
{{% /speaker-notes %}}

---

## Why is this important

CYF is a community. Everybody can challenge negative behaviour.

#### We are all responsible for building a friendly and safe environment for each other.

---

If you have any questions, please ask them :)
