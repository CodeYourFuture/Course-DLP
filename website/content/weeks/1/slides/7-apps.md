## App Stores (iOS and Android)

{{% speaker-notes %}}
iOS: App store
Android: Play Store 4. Think about how we can know if an app is safe to download. What should you consider? (things like ratings, comments, UI, the company publishing, etc.)

BE CAREFUL!
Do not let online sources pressure you into action
Be careful what you install and allow.
Only download things from the Play Store/App store or very trusted sources
Where possible, use popular/well known apps

Your camera “reads” a QR and opens a link
