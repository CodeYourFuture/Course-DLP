# DLP

This site is where the Digital Literacy Programme lives. It belongs to that team, and it uses the Common Theme.

## What is a Common Theme?

The documentation is here => https://common.codeyourfuture.io/

The theme is here => https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum and there's more extensive READMES in the subdirectories.

## Examples

https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/
https://workshops.codeyourfuture.io/
https://curriculum.migracode.org/

## Quickstart Mac

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
1. Create a new token, choosing `Public Repositories (read-only)` `0 Permissions` and add it to your `.env` as the value for `HUGO_CURRICULUM_GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN`.
1. Run `brew install go hugo` to install Go and Hugo globally
1. In the /template folder, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start the development server.
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:1313/` to see your site.

## Look and feel

To customise the css, make a dir `assets/custom-theme` and throw any scss in there. It will be compiled and added last. To change site logo/s, make a dir and add svgs to `assets/custom-images/site-logo/`. They will be added to the site header. Framework is here => https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum/tree/main/common-theme/assets/styles

### You really do need the token

> ERROR üè∑Ô∏è Site needs a GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN. Check the README

This platform has tight integration with Github APIs, so you can connect repos, pull in readmes, issues and PRs. To make this work you NEED a bearer token from Github. Go look in the curriculum READMEs for more details if the quickstart guide is not clear enough.

### Adding modules and making local changes

https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/

For each module you import, add a `replace` directive to your `go.mod` file - if you forget to do this, you won't get live updates to your site when shared content changes. CI will remind you if you forget.

### Vendoring

If you want to _see_ the files you just mounted into your virtual filesystem, run `hugo mod vendor` to copy the files into your site. This is useful for debugging and clarity, but not necessary for development.
